Pylon Smart Metering framework in C
===================================

[Project status: Work in Progress]

Pylon is a C framework to facilitate the interaction with arbitrary sensors,
emphasizing the field of Smart Metering. It is designed for OpenWrt to allow
the implementation of sensor gateways on embedded systems.

Features:
- Built-in support for different Smart Metering devices
- Provides an interface to sample from arbitrary sensors
- Ability to send measurements in real-time to a RESTful Web service
- Customizable logging facility

The framework includes the application smlogger to demonstrate these
capabilities.

Supported devices so far:
- Landis+Gyr E750 Smart Meter
- Fluksometer v2

OpenWrt Support:
- Package Makefile provided, no patches needed
- Depends on the libsml package which is currently outdated at the OpenWrt 
  repositories, update is pending

Prerequisites:
- libsml (https://github.com/dailab/libsml)
- libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
